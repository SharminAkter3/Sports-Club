        <h1>How does react work?</h1>
        <p>ReactJS is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for mobile and web application development. Created
            by Facebook, React contains a collection of reusable JavaScript code snippets used for user interface (UI)
            building called components.
            It's important to note that ReactJS is not a JavaScript framework. That's because it,s only responsible for
            rendering the components of an application's view layer.
        </p>

        <h1>Write down the difference between props and state in react?</h1>
        <p>props (short for “properties”) and state are both plain JavaScript objects. While both hold information that
            influences the output of render, they are different in one important way: props get passed to the component
            (similar to function parameters) whereas state is managed within the component (similar to variables
            declared within a function).</p>

        <h1>How does useEffect work in React ?</h1>
        <p>A functional React component uses props and/or state to calculate the output. If the functional component
            makes calculations that don't target the output value, then these calculations are named side-effects.
            Examples of side-effects are fetch requests, manipulating DOM directly, using timer functions like
            setTimeout(), and more. The component rendering and side-effect logic are independent. It would be a mistake
            to perform side-effects directly in the body of the component, which is primarily used to compute the
            output.</p>
